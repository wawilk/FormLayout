Decreases in FRB were found in the 1<Ø<2 mm class, mainly in the 10 -20 and 20-30 cm layers. Therefore, fine roots (Ø<2 mm) increased 19% in the surface layer (0-10 cm) and decreased 23% in the deepest layer. The FRL (Ø<2 mm) presented similar results to those of the FRB (Ø<2 mm), with 50% of roots concentrated in the 0-10 cm layer.
